## Methods

```{r echo=FALSE} 
## Read data
data <- read.table("data.txt", header=T)
#data[10,1] <- 11   # correct error

# Fit linear model
model <- lm(happiness ~ sunshine, data=data)

```

We collected data on `r nrow(data)` individuals and fitted a linear model.



## Results

We found that...

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Print results
library(xtable, quietly=T)
library(knitr)
kable(xtable(model)) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Plot
library(visreg, quietly=T)
visreg(model)
```

## Discussion

These results confirm that sunshine is good for happiness (slope = `r coef(model)[2]`).
