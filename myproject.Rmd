It is well known that individual well-being can be influenced by climatic conditions. However, ...


Methods
-------

```{r echo=FALSE} 
## Read data
data <- read.table("data.txt", header=T)
data[10,1] <- 11   # correct error

# Fit linear model
model <- lm(happiness ~ sunshine, data=data)

```

We collected data on `r nrow(data)` individuals and fitted a linear model.



Results
-------

We found that...

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Print results
library(xtable, quietly=T)
library(knitr)
kable(xtable(model)) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Plot
library(visreg, quietly=T)
visreg(model)
```

Discussion
----------

These results confirm that sunshine is good for happiness (slope = `r coef(model)[2]`).
